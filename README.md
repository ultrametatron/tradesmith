TradeSmith

TradeSmith is a modular AI-assisted trading intelligence system that integrates real-time market data, financial factor modeling, LLM-based decision-making, reinforcement learning adjustments, and end-of-day reporting.

The goal is to build an end-to-end research and execution pipeline that remains fully traceable, efficient, and easily extensible. It‚Äôs designed for use by researchers, algorithmic traders, and AI-assisted portfolio builders who want to prototype novel decision pipelines using open tooling and cloud-native infrastructure.

üöÄ Features
	‚Ä¢	Data Ingestion: Pull stock quotes, fundamentals, and ticker metadata from the FMP API
	‚Ä¢	Central Storage: Use Google BigQuery as a queryable, structured warehouse for all raw and derived data
	‚Ä¢	Factor Computation: Compute and score valuation, growth, quality, and technical signals per ticker
	‚Ä¢	LLM Decision Engine: Prompt an OpenAI model (e.g. o4-mini) to suggest portfolio actions
	‚Ä¢	Reinforcement Feedback: Adjust logic using post-hoc RL-light gradient approximations
	‚Ä¢	Daily Reporting: Automatically generate and store summaries, performance stats, and metadata
